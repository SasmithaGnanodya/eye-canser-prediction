# **App Name**: AlzEyePredict

## Core Features:

- App Title: Title/Header: "Eye Health AI - Alzheimer’s Risk Predictor".
- Image Upload: Allows users to upload an eye image for analysis.
- Risk Prediction: Uses a pre-trained Teachable Machine model (TLrDyyvTP) to predict Alzheimer’s risk based on glaucoma detection in the uploaded eye image.
- AI-Powered Result Interpretation: Generates a description about the result using the Google Gemini API, helps visualize the risk, and provides suggestions for future decisions. Gemini will act as a tool by intelligently incorporating various pieces of information (image analysis results, general knowledge about Alzheimer's, relevant health recommendations, etc.) into its output.
- Result Export: Export final risk prediction results as a PDF document.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) for a modern, high-tech, and serious tone, fitting for a health application dealing with risk assessment.
- Primary color: A subdued blue (#64B5F6) reminiscent of medical equipment. This will bring the application into alignment with other risk-assessment resources the patient may already be familiar with.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#4DB6AC), an analogous color, but distinct, will subtly draw attention to important elements, without alarming the user. Teal also nods to the importance of maintaining sharp mental faculties, as many ancient traditions ascribe enhanced cognition to the teal-colored Throat Chakra.
- Clean and professional typography to ensure readability and trust.
- Use simple, clear icons for easy navigation and understanding.
- Responsive layout to ensure compatibility across devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without distracting from the core functionality.
